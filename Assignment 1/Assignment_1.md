## :seedling: Description

A library management system is a software application that helps librarians manage the inventory, circulation, and cataloging of books. 

>* *Book:* This table stores information about each book in the library, such as title, ISBN, edition, year, and price. 
>* *Author:* This table stores information about each author who has written one or more books in the library, such as name, date of birth, nationality, and biography. 
>* *Publisher:* This table stores information about each publisher who has published one or more books in the library, such as name, address, phone, and website. 
>* *Genre:* This table stores information about each genre that categorizes one or more books in the library, such as name and description. 
>* *Customer:* This table stores information about each customer who has registered with the library, such as name, address, phone, email, and password. 
>* *Loan:* This table stores information about each loan that records the borrowing and returning of books by customers, books, loan date, due date, and return date.
